                            Everyone loves a plan, and being a project manager means I've put together my fair share of them. Taking the requirements, resources and dependencies and forming these into a realistic and deliverable plan is second nature to me.

                            Project structures can take many forms, from traditional waterfall models where you plan everything up front to more agile processes where you prioritise deliverables then estimate and plan these iteratively.

                            Of course in the real world things happen and change is inevitable so it is often necessary to review and adjust your plans.

                            The best way to do this is to talk to people, this sounds obvious but I've seen plenty of situations where a simple conversation would have saved everyone involved a lot of time and effort.
